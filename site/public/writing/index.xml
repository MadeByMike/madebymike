      <description>Like many people, I decided to redesign my website for 2018. In addition to updating the visual design, I changed the way I publish content. I want to share more than just long-form blog post, so expect to see CodePen collections, short lists, videos and links to content I&amp;rsquo;ve published elsewhere.
One of the things I am really excited about is the chance to share content and resources created by friends in the community.</description>

      <title>Using CSS variables correctly</title>

      <description>CSS Variables (also known as Custom Properties) are now supported in all modern browsers and people are starting to use them in production. This is great but they&amp;rsquo;re different from variables in preprocessors and I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen some examples of people using them without considering the advantage they offer.
They have the potential to change how we write and think about CSS. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a few quick demos that show some good and bad ways to use CSS variables, and how their differences from preprocessors might change how we structure CSS.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I wrote about fluid typography techniques that show how you can use calc() and viewport units to create transitions between different font-sizes as the viewport size changes. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more about how this technique works you should read my article Precise control over responsive typography.
Recently these ideas have circulated and gained more traction. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen more large sites using fluid typography and other people writing about it and expanding on my initial ideas and techniques.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you use CSS in your daily work, your primary goal is probably focused around making things &amp;lsquo;look right&amp;rsquo;. How this is achieved is often far less important than the end result. This means we care less about how CSS works than the correct syntax and visual results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interpolation in CSS without animation</title>

      <guid>/writing/interpolation-without-animation/</guid>
      <description>Interpolation is the estimation of a new value between two known values. This simple concept is vastly useful and it&amp;rsquo;s commonly seen in animation on the web. With animation you declare the target properties and the end-state, and the browser will workout out the values in-between. Animation happens over time, but this is not the only dimension where interpolation can occur. In fact we interpolate values regularly in design, albeit manually, and particularly in responsive design.</description>

      <description>When I was at school I had a strong interest in learning to code, but I was terrible at maths. My teachers and parents told me I would need strong mathematical abilities to be a good developer and although they didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it to be, I found this discouraging. I really wasn&amp;rsquo;t good with numbers and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see this changing.
On the one hand I was right, it didn&amp;rsquo;t change and I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently learnt to use maths to great effect when coding.</description>

      <description>I think many of us are not using SVG to its full potential. I often see SVG used as an alternative image format or as a simple solution for icons, and whilst it&amp;rsquo;s great for these things, it&amp;rsquo;s also a lot more than that. SVG can solve problems that HTML and CSS alone can&amp;rsquo;t. It has responsive properties that go beyond vector scaling, such as control over aspect ratio, embedded CSS and a unique co-ordinate system.</description>

      <description>Service workers can do a lot more than make web pages work offline but for most people, myself included, this will be their first experience with them. I recently implemented a simple offline page for my blog and was surprised with how easy it was. Full of confidence, I wanted to do more. I decided to start saving blog posts for offline reading and things escalated quickly. I soon learnt the rabbit hole is deep.</description>

      <description>Canvas is a really interesting piece of our web development toolkit, but it is often overlooked or misunderstood. It is, as the name suggests, very much a blank canvas; not providing much in the way of prebaked solutions. It is up to us as developers to ensure what we make with canvas, is accessible and performant.
Canvas has no DOM, so when compared to working with HTML and CSS it may be less intuitive, and more work.</description>

      <description>I recently completed my third attempt at implementing a style guide within my organisation. So far this is the first attempt that looks to be maintainable and has some traction outside the development team. I want to share with you how we got there and what I learnt from 2 failed attempts.
My first attempt at a style guide used an automated tool called KSS, it automatically generated a style guide from comments in the CSS.</description>

      <description>jQuery I love you. We&amp;rsquo;ve been together for 10 years and that&amp;rsquo;s more than 50 years in JavaScript framework lifetimes. I might see you now less often than I did once, but I need you now no less than when we first met.
I’ll never forget our first function together:
$(document).ready(function(){ alert(‘page loaded’); });  Ha! I hope you will forgive me for that alert. That’s how we did things then and I wanted to be sure you worked; of course you worked, I would never doubt it now.</description>

      <description>I want to share a design pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for icons. It&amp;rsquo;s a robust technique that works in almost any situation. With this technique you can use icons inline or append &amp;amp; prepend them to existing content. It works with paragraphs, headings, navigation items, buttons &amp;hellip;almost any element.

      <description>A few months ago I published a fluid type technique that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any JavaScript. Even though I consider it experimental the technique works well enough as a progressive enhancement and it generated a lot of interest, comments and suggestions. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put together a bunch of examples and address some comments.
Fluid type with pixels This is a simplified version of my original example. The minimum font size is 14px and the maximum is 22px.</description>

      <description>When starting a new project with new developers one of the first things I want to do is get on the same page in terms of how we structure and manage CSS.
There are so many methodologies and guidelines today that I wonder why you would bother writing your own detailed documentation.
It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple choose a methodology, choose a set of guidelines and choose a build process.

      <description>Today I received a DMCA takedown request against my personal website over a trivial GitHub project that involves a periodic table layout and information about HTML5 elements.
Update: The legal threats and the DMCA takedown request were withdrawn. In addition to that the person involved has apologised and as such I&amp;rsquo;ve removed the name from this post -I think that&amp;rsquo;s fair.
Normally I like to write about my projects and experiments but it seems this an unfortunate part of what we do so I will detail it here in case anyone else has this experience.</description>

      <description>It is possible to have precise control over responsive typography. Using calc() and viewport units you can create fluid type that scales perfectly between specific pixel values, within a specific viewport range.
 This text is limited to between 20px and 40px, over a viewport range of 600px to 800px.  I don’t know why we don’t see viewport units being used more extensively for creating designs with responsive typography.</description>

  First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of loading animations and neither are your users but sometimes, for various reasons an action is going to take time and we need to let people know we&amp;rsquo;re working on it.</description>

I published an article on the Codrops website: Resizing and Cropping Images with Canvas
This tutorial focuses on the interaction and design aspects of this task rather than just the technical details of using Canvas for image resampling.
I also recommend using this example with the FileReader and Drag and Drop APIs which are not covered in this tutorial.</description>

      <description>Instead of covering all properties of Flexbox this article focuses on understanding how Flexbox calculates the width of items. The examples in this article are all in the context of a horizontal layout, but the same logic applies if you use a vertical layout.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what Flexbox is, it&amp;rsquo;s a layout method best suited for distributing the available space inside a container, amongst child items, even when the number of child items, their size and even their DOM order is not known or might change.</description>

      <description>Merging deeply nested data in JSON is more difficult than it might seem.
In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve used a brute force approach when dealing with small and well structured data. This approach proved completely inadequate for large volumes of real world data.
Imagine we have a monthly darts competition and at the end of each month record the scores in a JSON file:
data_jan = { &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;mike&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;score&amp;#34;: 47 } data_feb = { &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;mike&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;score&amp;#34;: 25 }  (I have no clue what a darts score should look like)</description>

      <description>Contrast is a critical factor in web design, it&amp;rsquo;s important to get right because it has a strong influence on the visual aesthetic, but it&amp;rsquo;s especially important for readability and accessibility of text on the page.
It&amp;rsquo;s not a revolutionary idea to suggest that we use Less or Sass to help choose an appropriate text color for a particular background. There are plenty of examples of this, but what is the best way?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the css transition events in JavaScript you will know that it&amp;rsquo;s a little involved due to the need for multiple browser prefixes. Luckily it&amp;rsquo;s easy, if slightly verbose, to detect which transition event to use:
// Dave Walsh says this is from Modernizr, but I can&amp;#39;t find it  // http://davidwalsh.name/css-animation-callback  var whichTransitionEvent = function(){ var t; var el = document.createElement(&amp;#39;fakeelement&amp;#39;); var transitions = { &amp;#39;transition&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;transitionend&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;OTransition&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;oTransitionEnd&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;MozTransition&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;transitionend&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;WebkitTransition&amp;#39;:&amp;#39;webkitTransitionEnd&amp;#39; }; for(t in transitions){ if( el.</description>

      <guid>/writing/thoughts-on-design-patterns-in-css/</guid>
      <description>Typically when we begin a new web project we start by creating a number of directories for CSS, JavaScript and other resources. This task hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much and it&amp;rsquo;s a typical step for most developers. In many cases, this structure is a non-optional part of the workflow enforced by scaffolding tools like yeoman, an MVC framework or a boilerplate.
Reasons behind it relate to the well-established principle separation of concerns. In web development we get separation of concerns for free.</description>
