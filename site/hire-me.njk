<p>I&#x27;m a skilled engineer. I&#x27;m comfortable with tools such as React, Node, ES6, Webpack etc. but I don&#x27;t like listing tools and libraries. I am comfortable learning new languages, libraries and tools when required. I have done this before and I will no doubt have to do it again.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a creative, innovative and dedicated developer. I have a deep understanding front-end technologies such as CSS and SVG, but also of the web as a platform. I know how browsers work. I read specifications and so many blog posts. There is a good chance I know how to solve specific problems or where to find the answer.</p>
<p>I am an effective team builder. I&#x27;ve led teams. I&#x27;ve worked remotely and I&#x27;m a mentor in my community. I&#x27;ve worked for myself, in small agencies and in large corporate environments. I know the many shapes teams can take and how to be effective in each case. I value diversity that&#x27;s why I help organise a program called <a href="https://codebar.io/sydney">CodeBar in Sydney</a> to support underrepresented groups in tech. I don&#x27;t just build teams I build community. I can do this for you too.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m adaptable. I&#x27;ve worked on some of Australia&#x27;s largest websites as well as the smallest community sites. I&#x27;ve built websites, applications and data visualisations on numerous platforms. </p>
<p>I have spoken at dozens of conferences and community-level events around Australia, Europe, UK, and the US. I have written numerous technical articles some of which are here on my personal blog, as well as on websites like Smashing Magazine and Codrops. </p>
