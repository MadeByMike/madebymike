    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>Oh, hey! You’re still here, good for you! You should know I’m passionate about web development and that doesn’t just mean standards; I’m an advocate for anything and anyone that contributes to good quality web development.</p>
    <p>I’ve worked as a front-end developer on some of Australia’s largest websites as well as some of the smallest community sites. When I’m not building sites or blogging I like to experiment with code. I love learning new things and finding techniques that challenge what we think is best practice. Although very few ideas make it into my production toolkit, I find experimentation is the best way learn and the only way to discover new techniques.</p>
    <p>I try to share everything I learn, I speak, I blog and sometimes help organise community events and meetups.</p>
    <p>I’m available for hire! Why don’t you <a href="mailto:mike@madebymike.com.au">get in touch?</a>
