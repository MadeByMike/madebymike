I'm a skilled engineer. I'm comfortable with tools such as React, Node, ES6, Webpack etc. but I don't like listing tools and libraries. I am comfortable learning new languages and tools as required. I have done this before, and I'm sure I will have to do it again.

I'm a creative, innovative and dedicated developer. I have a deep understanding of front-end development and the web in general. I like to work with the core technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript but there's a good chance I'm using the latest frameworks too. But my knowledge is not limited to frameworks. I know how browsers work. I read specifications and many, many blog posts. There is a good chance I know how to solve specific problems or where to find the answers.

I am an effective team builder. I can lead teams and work effectively as part of one. I've worked for myself, in small agencies and in large corporate environments. I know the many shapes teams can take, and how to be effective in each case. I value diversity that's why I help organise a program called [CodeBar in Sydney](https://codebar.io/sydney) to support underrepresented groups in tech. I work with other community groups as well. I don't just build teams I build community. I can do this for you too.

I'm adaptable. I've worked on some of Australia's largest websites as well as the smallest community sites. I've built websites, applications and data visualisations on numerous platforms.

I have spoken at dozens of conferences and community-level events around Australia, Europe UK, and the US. I have written numerous technical articles some of which are here on my personal blog, as well as on websites like Smashing Magazine and Codrops.
