I published an article on the Codrops website: [Resizing and Cropping Images with Canvas](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/10/30/resizing-cropping-images-canvas/)

Learn how to resize and crop images using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element using controls, commonly seen in photo editing applications.

This tutorial focuses on the interaction and design aspects of this task rather than just the technical details of using Canvas for image resampling.

I also recommend using this example with the FileReader and Drag and Drop APIs which are not covered in this tutorial.

A huge thanks to Mary Lou (Manoela Ilic) for support with the design and much more!
