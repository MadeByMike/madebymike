title: Resizing and Cropping Images with Canvas
---
Learn how to resize and crop images using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element using controls, commonly seen in photo editing applications.

I published an article on the Codrops website: [Resizing and Cropping Images with Canvas](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/10/30/resizing-cropping-images-canvas/)

This tutorial focuses on the interaction and design aspects of this task rather than just the technical details of using Canvas for image resampling.

I also recommend using this example with the FileReader and Drag and Drop APIs which are not covered in this tutorial.

A huge thanks to Mary Lou (Manoela Ilic) for support with the design and much more!
