title: Thoughts on design patterns in css
---

Thanks to a friend I recently rediscovered the 1995 book, Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. I had been unconsciously aware of the influence of this book, mainly through reference to it in more modern works, such as Addy Osmani's, [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ ).

I spent a weekend reading the original book, then re-reading Addy Osmani's JavaScript Design Patterns, before moving on to a number of blogs and other sources on the topic. 

After consuming as much information as I could find, I couldn't help but wonder if this concept of design patterns might apply to css with pre-compilers such as Less and Sass involved.

Features like variables, mixins and extend mean that it should be possible to implement many object oriented design patterns, or variations of them, in css development.

For some reason I haven't found much discussion on this topic yet. Perhaps the concept doesn't translate as well as I imagine? Perhaps there hasn't been enough time for design patterns to emerge in css? Or perhaps simply the keyword 'Design Pattern' means something else to search engines when css is involved?

This is more of an open ended thought than a conclusion, so if you have any thoughts, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeRiethmuller">Iâ€™d love to hear them</a>.
