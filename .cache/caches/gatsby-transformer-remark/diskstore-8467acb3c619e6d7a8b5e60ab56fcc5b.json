I'm comfortable with tools such as React, Node, ES6, Webpack etc. but I don't like listing tools and libraries. I am comfortable learning new languages, libraries and tools when required. I have done this before and I will no doubt have to do it again.</p>\n<p>I'm a creative, innovative and dedicated developer. I have a deep understanding front-end technologies such as CSS and SVG, but also of the web as a platform. I know how browsers work. I read specifications and so many blog posts. There is a good chance I know how to solve specific problems or where to find the answer.</p>\n<p>I am an effective team builder. I've led teams. I've worked remotely and I'm a mentor in my community. I've worked for myself, in small agencies and in large corporate environments. I know the many shapes teams can take and how to be effective in each case. I value diversity that's why I help organise a program called <a href=\"https://codebar.io/sydney\">CodeBar in Sydney</a> to support underrepresented groups in tech. I don't just build teams I build community. I can do this for you too.</p>\n<p>I'm adaptable. I've worked on some of Australia's largest websites as well as the smallest community sites. I've built websites, applications and data visualisations on numerous platforms. </p>\n<p>I have spoken at dozens of conferences and community-level events around Australia, Europe, UK, and the US. I have written numerous technical articles some of which are here on my personal blog, as well as on websites like Smashing Magazine and Codrops. </p>\n<h2>What can I help with?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready to make use of CSS Grid or Custom Properties and not sure where to start?</li>\n<li>Want to write better responsive design patterns?</li>\n<li>Need help implementing a design system or building a UI library?</li>\n<li>Have an innovative application, visualisation or product idea?</li>\n<li>Have a team that needs help or training with any of the above?  </li>\n<li>Working on something larger?
