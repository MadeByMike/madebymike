        <h1>Hi, I'm Mike</h1>

<p>I'm a web developer. When I'm not making websites for others, I'm usually developing tools and techniques for web enthusiasts like myself. You will find some of my creations here.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about good practice web development and that doesn't just mean web standards. I'm an advocate for anything and anyone that contributes professionalism in web development.</p>

<p>I've been working with the web for more than 10 years. I've worked on many large government site as well as the smallest community sites. I've developed apps, JavaScript libraries, CSS frameworks and all manner of site small and complex.</p>

<p>Much of this work has been for private business and my goal now is to make more of my work publicly available and open source.</p>

<p>My main strengths are in working with JavaScript and PHP but I will happily work with a little PERL, Ruby or Python and almost any framework if required. I have my favorite tools but always use the one for the job.</p>
