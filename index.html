<h1>Hi, I'm Mike</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer. I make all sorts of things for the web. You can find some of my creations here.</p>
<p>When I'm not making things for the web I sometimes think about stuff and on rare occasions I write about it. You might find some of my writing here. </p>

	<h2>More about me</h2>
	<p>I'm passionate about good web development practices and that doesn't just mean standards. I'm am an advocate for anything or anyone that contributes to good quality web development.</p>
	<p>I've worked on large government sites as well as the smallest community sites. I develop apps, JavaScript libraries, CSS frameworks and all manner of sites small and complex.</p>
	<p>Much of my work has been for private business but my goal now is to make more of my work publicly available.</p>
	<p>My main strength are in working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS but I will happily work with almost any language or framework. I have my favourite tools but always use the one for the job.</p>
	<p>You can checkout <a href="https://github.com/MadeByMike">some of my stuff on GitHub</a></p>
